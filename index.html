          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="COVERT">COVERT</h1><p>&#160;Bride in Japan is dressed in totally white which was once assumed to be twelve pieces (in Japanese, Jūni-no-hitoe 十二の単) that hide the new wife’s body from all’s sight, putting up exaggeratively white make-up to which small scarlet lips are compared. White stands for candor, loyalty and chasteness, while red presents youth, vitality and fertility. The rite is always traditionally held in a shrine(in Japanese,Jin-ja) and led by the priest in Jin-ja(in Japanese, Gūji).Mysterically, yet obviously this woman is ready for keeping to some extent from the public and from then on she leaves the family that gave her birth for the one of her husband in a very initial way of changing her surname to his.</p>
<p>&#160;The daytime of Sendai in weekdays is embedded with wives away from working, and it is almost like silver thread running across the japanese brocade(in Japanese, Nishiki). Most new wives perhaps stick still to the job in office, while a few of them leave the work place for kitchen. Doing house work and attending as community volunteer are nearly the inside and outside field of them till they have a baby and another and very probably a next.</p>
<p> Carrying a baby in a baby sacbag in front of breast and followed by a little child around, new and amateur mothers drop at supermarket for new promotion and bargain from possibly the way of paying for the bills or making children’s health examination or having consult about insurance in ward office and so on. So do the wives at the age of mother-in-law. The background music is piano and vivace played. It’s alomost the same in every supermarket. So do the wives move in it. Every face of make-up, neatly set hair and fixed thin mouth speaks artificially friendlily softly and no mean for offending.</p>
<p>&#160;Cafe is a good place for wives to have a talk when they take a breakup from a shopping mall in the afternoon, for they have to do charge of preparing garbs of their partners. Paper bags piled around feet are branded with different logo which is familiar to most Japanese. Smiling ma’mes are talking lightly and nodding timely to agree under the lounge music in the sunshine through the comparted window decorated by passers-by on the lane outside. </p>
<p>&#160;Actually, all of this scenery fades not so late. The mama goes back home to prepare for the supper, and drives the car to the JR (Japanese railway) station to pick up her boys and girls after school, maybe even later again in the night for her husband. And it is almost the all of the homemaker wives’ stereotyped life. What kind of fun can they make from it? I do not quite clearly understand. I supposed that I would talk something about the love affair (in Japanese, furin) or Wives’ Club (in Japanese, hitoduma-club kind of a organization held for making chance for marital infidelity…), but I finally gave up this idea. I guess I will mention in an undetermined future…</p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="INTRO_–_TURN-UPS">INTRO – TURN-UPS</h1><p>&#160; An evening in Sendai is a little bit chilly but cozy. Bistro and bar have just been ready for all kinds of tired souls.It isn’t hard to conceal in mob of smelly sweat wafting across Haut Parfum. The faces wearing thin silvery hair walking neck by neck and carrying file bags are absorbingly talking about anecdotes around and bound for the next izakaya (Sake bar). Mademoiselles who loose their bunched long hair, maybe pinching a slim cigarette burning dimly, are fiddling mobile phone in a cornor of cafe and at the same while I guess they never make sense of the background music from Astor Piazzolla absolutely. Young couples are from the high school. Uniform girl with thick make-up in her young lovers arm looking at the dool which is seized in the UFO Catcher game lift her eyes to her hero’s face. Apparently, he is too yound to be a true hero and trimmed eyebrow, colored curled hair and face with speckle can only add to his young extra passion. The pair of backs laso disappear in the crowd under flashing neon.</p>
<p>&#160; It’s some how return to life now in Sendai. The night life of Sendai-ers, even of Japanese, has just sprung out. Darkness brightened up by man-made electric light make men feel safe. They mingle themselves in the crowd without smile or artificial concern and even losing temporarially the sense of feeling. But humanbeing do de facto disgust of known such as unseen in the darkness. Night calms down and save back the nervous hearts from offices, schools and all sorts of cases that human have to pretend to be kind and hide their ho-ne (Japanses, true voice).Yet night whereas can’t help when they can’t see in darness. So the instinct of fearing dark is well-known that night is just an AGNUS for UNSEEN in night itself.</p>
<p>&#160; One friend of mine once told me he liked the black and night. He is a simple one with complicated structure in brain when he soaks in the machinery world and untouchable digital world. A materialistic and canophilic guy whose dream is to live in a lodge in north Europe, accompanied by 3 husky dogs and several sets of high-speed computers and a wife(?) perhaps. His partner told me he liked to see movie all kinds of, but he seldom knew the romance in love and tortured inside for his hurting a girls heart. His partner, my cherished friend, told me some time ago he was an big boy not grown-up yet. I said he was a magic pot in which contrary potions were mixed together. And I guess that’s why he loves darkness and night even fearing of unknown and unseen.</p>
<p>&#160; The night relaxation belongs to the one hide in daytime. Yes,obviously, SOME ONES hide themselves in night. They show up in daytime and whenever and wherever their night active partners are not. That is the confidential Japanese wife…</p>
